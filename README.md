# AnimatedCV

This little project was created during the last week of the orientation course at [Digital Career Institute](https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/). It is a pure HTML and CSS based animation of my CV. I even managed to make this slighly responsive. 

**Time for realization: 3 days**

Feel free to use the sourcecode and stylesheet and adapt it for your own purposes. 

**Have fun!**
